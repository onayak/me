  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>The little things that inspire us to make life altering decisions sometimes are noticed only in retrospect;</p>
  <p>As I progress in my career I have been swayed to find innovative paths, connecting users to technology in an impactful and accessible way for all. My experience in consulting for health care projects helped me understand the role of user data research in user centric product and service design. It opened the window to the world of design and pursuing Masters in Information at the University of Michigan with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction.</p>
  <p>With this blend of interests, I am looking for opportunities to learn by innovating solutions with design, user research and the data around us. Have a look at my recent PROJECTS!</p>
